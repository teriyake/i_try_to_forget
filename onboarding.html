                This extension is an artistic exploration of duration, memory,
                and materiality in the context of digital interaction.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                To create "memories," the extension will occasionally and
                randomly save small, harmless snippets of text and images from
                the websites you visit. These fragments will then be displayed
                on other pages you browse.
            </p>
