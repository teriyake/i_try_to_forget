# Privacy Policy for "i try to forget"

**Effective Date:** 11/13/2025

Thank you for using "i try to forget," an experimental browser extension. This privacy policy explains what data the extension handles and, more importantly, what it **does not** do.

The core privacy principle is simple: **Your data stays on your computer. Period.**

### 1. What Information We Collect

To function, "i try to forget" needs to create "memories" from your browsing. The extension collects two types of information:

*   **Text Snippets:** Small, randomly selected fragments of text from the body of websites you visit.
*   **Image URLs:** The web addresses (URLs) of randomly selected images displayed on websites you visit.

The collection process is automated, random, and is not designed to target any specific personal information.

**What We DO NOT Collect:**  
We want to be clear: the extension **never** collects, stores, or has access to:
*   Your browsing history.
*   Personal identifiers like your name, email address, or IP address.
*   Information you type into forms (like passwords or credit card numbers).
*   Cookies or tracking data from websites.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

The collected text snippets and image URLs are used for the **single purpose** of the extension: to display them as temporary, fading "memory" overlays on the webpages you browse. This is the core of the conceptual experimentation.

### 3. Where Your Information is Stored

All collected information ("memories") is stored **exclusively on your local computer** using the standard `chrome.storage.local` browser API. This data **never leaves your device** and is **never transmitted to, stored on, or processed by any external server**, including our own.

### 4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We **do not share, sell, rent, or trade** your information with any third parties because we never have access to it in the first place. Since the data never leaves your computer, there is no one for us to share it with.

### 5. User Control and Data Management

You have complete control over your data. The extension's popup interface, accessible from the browser toolbar, allows you to:

*   **Enable or Disable** all memory collection and injection functionality at any time.
*   **View a list** of all currently stored memories.
*   **Delete individual memories** one by one.
*   **Delete all stored memories** at once with a single click.

Upon installation, the extension also requires your explicit consent via an onboarding screen before any data collection begins.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we ever update this policy, we will notify users through the extension's description on the Chrome Web Store. However, our core commitment to keeping your data local and private will not change.
